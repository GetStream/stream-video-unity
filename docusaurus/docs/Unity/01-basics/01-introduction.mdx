Stream Video SDK is built on top of [Unity's WebRTC library](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.webrtc@3.0/manual/index.html), adhering to the same requirements.

#### Where to begin?
The best way to quickly get familiar with the key components of our SDK is to follow one of the tutorials. We're currently featuring:
1. [Video Calling](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/unity/tutorial/video-calling/) - Video & Audio streaming.
2. [Audio Rooms](https://getstream.io/video/sdk/unity/tutorial/audio-room/) - Audio-only communication.

Alternatively, you can start with the [Installation Guide](./basics/installation/) and either proceed with the [Core Concepts Guides](./guides/client-auth/) or the [Quickstart Guide](./basics/quickstart/) if you wish to skim through the most basic features. For building on **Android** or **iOS** platforms, be sure to explore the [Platform Guides](./platforms/overview/).
